# Beam Me Up Watson
This lab, jointly presented by IBM and STMicrolectronics, combines a ST BlueCoin IoT starter kit, a mobile app and a set of IBM Cloud services to build a lapel communicator and sensor platform. Following the lab you will learn how to connect the BlueCoin, send sensor data and voice, and build an IBM Cloud app using a number of services including Watson IoT Platform, Node-Red and Watson Assistant to consume and interact with the sensor and voice data.

The diagram below shows how the components of the Lab link together.  What is built in the lab is an exemplar of a typical IoT solution. The lab provides a solid grounding in the principles of IoT and once completed will enable richer and more diverse projects to be undertaken.
