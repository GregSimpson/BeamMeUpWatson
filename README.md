# BeamMeUpWatson
Beam Me Up Watson! is a hands on workshop jointly presented by IBM and STMicrolectronics. It brings together a BlueCoin (IoT starter kit), a mobile app and a set of IBM Cloud services to recreate the original Star Trek lapel communicator. Attendees will learn how to connect the BlueCoin, send sensor data and voice, and build an IBM Cloud app using a number of services including Watson IoT Platform, Watson Assistant and voice services to consume and interact with the sensor and voice data.
